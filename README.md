Technologies used -

  For this project I really wanted to highlight CSS, more specifically the transition and transform properties.
  Wanted to make something fun and interactive.  

  For DOM manipulation I used jQuery, just because of its shorter syntax.  I spent a lot of time on the board and
  figuring out the CSS, so using jQuery saved me some time.  

  I added a Google font for h1 and h2.  

Approach -

  Using trello I planned out my time, 1st day doing the html/css and the 2nd day jQuery.  I had a little back and forth,
  but mostly stuck to that.  I did wireframe the board, but not in detail, you can see its pretty simple.  Psuedocode
  helped me get what I wanted down for my jQuery, useful tool to really plan what you need to figure out before you code.
  I used it often.

Installation -

  Please fork a repo to your account, clone and enjoy!

Unsolved issues -

  Clicking the cards too quickly will cause the cards not to flip.  Blocking the transition, instantly comparing the two cards.
  I didn't get to all my user stories.
